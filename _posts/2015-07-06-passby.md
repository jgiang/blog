As mentioned in the first blog post, primitive data is passed by value and everything else is passed by
reference. 

### What does that mean?

When we talk about passing data into a function, we need to distinguish between passing by value and
passing by reference.
The value of data is like the 1s and 0s that it is made up of. When data is passed by value,
it is *copied* in memory and the function operates on the copy of the data. A reference to something
is like a pointer to its address in memory. When data is passed by reference, a copy of this pointer
is given to the function. Thus, the function operates on the data stored at the address and is free
to modify the data. To see an example of the difference, step through the code snippets below.


Notice how num is *not* modified when we call addToNum, but x's value changes because we reassign
it. Reassignment is an essential way to modify data that is passed by value. If you have access to
the variable you want to modify, you can reassign inside the function. Otherwise, you can return the
modified value and reassign the variable to the return value of the function call.

Notice how numArr *is* modified whenever we call pushToArr.
